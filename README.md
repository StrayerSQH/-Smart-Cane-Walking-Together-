# 智能拐杖，志愿同行
## 🔥关于此项目
“智能拐杖·志愿同行”是一个专为视障人群设计的出行生态系统，由政府、手机制造企业、公民共同参与。该系统利用IoT等技术，在传统拐杖中嵌入单片机，使其能与手机及相关基础设施通过蓝牙连接。在红绿灯路口，该系统能提供无接触式改变红绿灯指示信号服务，并引导视障人群正确走向对面路口盲道口。在市政施工路段，相关单位设置临时信标，告知视障人群前方有危险。两种场景下均可通过生态系统呼唤附近的注册志愿者，以获得协助通行。
## 🚀项目发展历史
- **项目启动**  
此项目最初由四川大学计算机学院的张老师于2024年4月提出创意。随后，由四川大学计算机学院的崔同学（组长）带领的团队，包括和同学、王同学、孙同学等多名成员，在2024年4月至6月期间收集了部分资料，并计划参加2024年开放原子行比赛。然而，由于一些原因，团队最终解散，项目也随之终止。
- **项目重启与暂停**  
2024年9月，经过四川大学计算机学院的孙同学和崔同学的商议，决定由孙同学接任组长，重启该项目。不幸的是，由于部分原因，项目再次遭遇暂停。
- **项目获奖一**  
2024年11月，四川大学计算机学院的孙同学和王同学，以及四川大学电子信息学院的李同学和牛同学，还有四川大学文学与新闻学院的杨同学，将此项目用于参加2024年四川大学电子信息学院第十一届概念产品设计大赛，并荣获一等奖。
- **项目再次重启**  
进入2024年12月，孙同学将项目领导权交给了四川大学计算机学院的王同学，作为新的组长，重启项目，并计划参加2024年全国大学生计算机设计大赛（物联网赛道）。

# Smart Cane, Walking Together
## 🔥 About This Project
"Smart Cane, Walking Together" is a mobility ecosystem designed specifically for the visually impaired, involving government, mobile phone manufacturers, and citizens. This system utilizes IoT and other technologies to embed microcontrollers in traditional canes, enabling them to connect with mobile phones and related infrastructure via Bluetooth. At traffic light intersections, the system can provide contactless services to change traffic light signals and guide the visually impaired to the correct side-walk path. In areas with municipal construction, relevant units set up temporary beacons to inform the visually impaired of potential dangers ahead. In both scenarios, the ecosystem can call upon nearby registered volunteers for assistance in crossing.

## 🚀 Project Development History
- **Project Launch**
The project was initially conceived by Professor Zhang from the School of Computer Science at Sichuan University in April 2024. Subsequently, a team led by Cui, a student from the same school (team leader), including He, Wang, Sun, and several other members, collected some materials from April to June 2024 and planned to participate in the 2024 OpenAtom Open-Source Competition. However, due to some reasons, the team eventually disbanded, and the project was also terminated.
- **Project Restart and Suspension**
In September 2024, after discussion between Sun and Cui, students from the School of Computer Science at Sichuan University, it was decided that Sun would take over as team leader to restart the project. Unfortunately, due to some reasons, the project was suspended again.
- **Project Award One**
In November 2024, Sun and Wang from the School of Computer Science, Li and Niu from the School of Electronic Information Engineering, and Yang from the College of Literature and Journalism at Sichuan University used this project to participate in the 11th Concept Product Design Competition of the School of Electronic Information Engineering in 2024 and won the first prize.
- **Project Restart Again**
In December 2024, Sun handed over the project leadership to Wang, a student from the School of Computer Science at Sichuan University, who, as the new team leader, restarted the project and planned to participate in the 2024 National College Student Computer Design Competition (IoT Track).
