# 智能拐杖，志愿同行
## 🔥关于此项目
“智能拐杖·志愿同行”是一个专为视障人群设计的出行生态系统，由政府、手机制造企业、公民共同参与。该系统利用IoT等技术，在传统拐杖中嵌入单片机，使其能与手机及相关基础设施通过蓝牙连接。在红绿灯路口，该系统能提供无接触式改变红绿灯指示信号服务，并引导视障人群正确走向对面路口盲道口。在市政施工路段，相关单位设置临时信标，告知视障人群前方有危险。两种场景下均可通过生态系统呼唤附近的注册志愿者，以获得协助通行。
## 🚀项目发展历史

# Smart Cane, Walking Together
## 🔥 About This Project
"Smart Cane, Walking Together" is a mobility ecosystem designed specifically for the visually impaired, involving government, mobile phone manufacturers, and citizens. This system utilizes IoT and other technologies to embed microcontrollers in traditional canes, enabling them to connect with mobile phones and related infrastructure via Bluetooth. At traffic light intersections, the system can provide contactless services to change traffic light signals and guide the visually impaired to the correct side-walk path. In areas with municipal construction, relevant units set up temporary beacons to inform the visually impaired of potential dangers ahead. In both scenarios, the ecosystem can call upon nearby registered volunteers for assistance in crossing.

## 🚀 Project Development History
- **Project Initiation**  
  In April 2024, Professor Zhang from the School of Computer Science at Sichuan University conceived the project. Subsequently, a team led by Cui (Team Leader) from the School of Computer Science, including He, Wang, Sun, and others, collected materials from April to June and planned to participate in the 2024 Open Atom Challenge. However, the team disbanded due to certain reasons, and the project was terminated.

- **Project Restart and Suspension**  
  In September 2024, after discussions between Sun and Cui from the School of Computer Science, Sun took over as the team leader and restarted the project. Later, the project was suspended again due to certain reasons.

- **Project Award I**  
  In November 2024, Sun and Wang from the School of Computer Science, Li and Niu from the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, and Yang from the School of Literature and Journalism, used this project to participate in the 11th Concept Product Design Competition of the School of Electronics and Information Engineering at Sichuan University and won the first prize.

- **Project Restart II**  
  In December 2024, Sun handed over the project to Wang from the School of Computer Science to serve as the team leader, who then restarted the project with plans to participate in the 2024 National College Students Computer Design Contest (IoT Track).

- **Project Award II**  
  In May 2025, Wang and Sun from the School of Computer Science, Li from the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, and Liu from the School of Cyber Security, used this project to participate in the Hua Di Cup·2025 Sichuan Provincial College Students Computer Design Contest and the 18th Chinese College Students Computer Design Contest Sichuan Provincial Contest, and won the third prize at the provincial level.
